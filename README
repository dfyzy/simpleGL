Using OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW and libpng(also boost/thread because my compiler has no thread)

You can draw stuff now.

TODO:
-Fonts
-Better texture loading(clusters)
-Buffer data resizing
-Window resizability
-Particles????(because really, we already draw instances, surely there is no need for further optimization)
-Audio
-Custom shaders
-Networking
